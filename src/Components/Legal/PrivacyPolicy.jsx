                We may host surveys for survey creators for our Platform who are

                sell your responses. Anything you expressly disclose in your

                share your survey responses
              </p>
              <p>
                Information collected will not be considered as sensitive if it

                furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005, any rules
                made thereunder or any other law for the time being in force.
                Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure
                that all of your private communications and other personally
                identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not
                otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example
                (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
                information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third
                parties. Therefore, although we use industry-standard practices

                information shall be personally intimated to you through an
                email sent to your provided email address.

                the following describes some of the ways that your personally

              <p>
                External Service Providers: There may be several services
                offered by external service providers that help you use our
                Platform. If you choose to use these optional services, and in
                the course of doing so, disclose information to the external
                service providers, and/or permit them to collect information
                about you, then their use of your information is governed by
                their privacy policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                b.Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as
                well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as
                intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can
                (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to
                law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our
                sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection
                with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property
                infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose
